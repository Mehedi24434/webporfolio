                            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, which is the largest river delta in the world. The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.
The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers, making the resolution of water issues politically complicated, in most cases, as the country is a lower riparian state to India. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh#Geography" target="_blank">(more...)</a></p></div>

Pakistan. India and Pakistan got independence from the British rule in
1947. Pakistan was formed for the Muslims and India had a majority of
Hindus. Pakistan had two parts, East and West, which were separated by
about 1,000 miles. East Pakistan was mainly the eastern part of the
province of Bengal. The capital of Pakistan was Karachi in West Pakistan
and was moved to Islamabad in 1958. However, due to discrimination in
economy and ruling powers against them, the East Pakistanis vigorously
protested and declared independence on March 26, 1971 under the
leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But during the year prior to that,
to suppress the unrest in East Pakistan, the Pakistani government sent
troops to East Pakistan and unleashed a massacre. And thus, the war for
liberation commenced.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War" target="_blank">(more...)</a></p></div>

To counteract this imbalance, a policy of industrialization was adopted in the mid-20th century. During the period of Pakistani administration (1947–71), priority was given to industries based on indigenous raw materials such as jute, cotton, hides, and skins. The principle of free enterprise in the private sector was accepted, subject to certain conditions, including the national ownership of public utilities. The industrial policy also aimed to develop the production of consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Bangladesh" target="_blank">(more...)</a></p></div>

Yes, of-course my model is prophet Muhammad(SM). But as a normal human being I can't be 100% pure like him but I should try as much as I can. So, patriotism must be accustomed to me. 
So, to be a patriot person I have to set my life goal for doing something good for my country! on the other hand, my country has a glorious history of liberation war which is always inspired me to do something special for my own county.

                                            <p>Luckily I have got chance to complete my graduation at the best university of my country. To serve own county there are many ways  like staying here or by going to abroad.
To me going abroad is really a terrible scenario. It's like to be apart from my family, from my loving one! I think it will make me upset and more frustrated.
So, finally I have decided to be here at my own county and to do something special for my county. My favourite occupation for this reasons is to be a part of Bangladesh Civil Service. It is the opportunity which can make the chance to make something good, change some bad system for my county. It is also the most respectful occupation for my county. I am doing my best to grab this chance. May Allah help me.
